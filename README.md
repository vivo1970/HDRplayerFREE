# HDRplayerFREE
Limited Slideshow of HDR still photos - AVIF and JPEG
(EXE and PDF inside a ZIP file for download)

To allow everyone—not just supporters, but literally all users—to verify HDR image display functionality using an HDR monitor, we have decided to release a free Windows PC software after initial development of HDRplayer.

HDRplayer-DEMO.EXE enables users to:
- Confirm a major milestone in HDRplayer’s development
- Verify their Windows PC supports HDR photo display
- Test HDR image rendering on their HDR display 

This free demo software performs these operations:
- Automatically creates a slideshow with 5-second slide intervals
- Displays images in full-screen mode (any screen size)
- Handles both SDR and HDR images
- Processes only HDR-compatible files (JPEG or preferably AVIF) located in “C:\HDRplayer\images”

Limitations of this free demo slideshow:
- Maximum 30 images (excess files are selected alphabetically)
- Sequential slide progression stops in 10 minutes
